# MemoQ WebTools
## What's this?
(Currently) a very modest set of tools needed to improve translator's user experience with MemoQ WebTrans product. 

## Why so serious?
The product in question lacks many tools needed to make translator's job easier and more enojyable. One of the most annoying things is - you can't just go to the next segment missing translation quickly or filter them, so if there are new segments among those previously translated and confirmed you have to look through the pages and check them manually. It's boring, tiresome and annoying task to say the least. And, seemingly, Kilgray have no intentions to fix them, so I've tried to fix some of them myself.
